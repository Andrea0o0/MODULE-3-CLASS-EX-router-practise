# React-router-dom practise üõ§

This project was initialized with <code>create-react-app</code>. Then, <code>react-router-dom</code> was installed, so everything is up and running. *BrowserRouter* was already implemented in the <code>index.js</code> file.

To start, you only need to run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Iteration 1: The navigation üõ≥

### The routes

Right now, our <code>App.js</code> component is only displaying the <code>Home</code> component, but we don't have a way of accessing the other views, such as Contacts or Projects.

- Use the `<Routes>` tag to create a specific `<Route>` for each one of our views: **for now just do Home, Contact and Projects**.

üí° Remember the Route syntax:
```js
<Route path="contact" element={<Contact/>} />
```

- Also, include a `Route` for those cases when the user has typed a route that doesn't exist, and make sure it displays the error page.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to import the components and everything you need from 'react-router-dom', or it won't work.

### The navbar

- Create a `Navbar` component to be able to access those routes, and import it into the App.js file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è When doing the navbar also remember to import the Link from 'react-router-dom'.

When you finish this iteration, **you should be able to navigate through the different views of the app with your navbar**.

---

## Iteration 2: Nested routes ü™∫

As you can see, we have a `ProjectsApps` component and a `ProjectsGames` component. That is because these components are supposed to be displayed into the `Projects` component.

1. In the `App.js` file, create a nested route to make sure the final routes are: 
- projects/games
- projects/apps

2. In the `Projects` view, create a small navigation system (buttons, links or whichever one you prefer) to switch between games and apps

3. In the `Projects` view, use the `<Outlet/>` component from 'react-router-dom' to make sure the `games` and `apps` components are displayed when the route matches.

### When you finish, it should do the following:
